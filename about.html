                <h2> Ranyel Queiroz </h2>
                <p>I'm a huge fan of technology and in the end of 2022 I started my journey in this field. At the
                    moment, I aim to be able to solve most issues related to software. I am 21 years old and currently
                    studying ADS (Analysis and Systems Development) at UNINTER. I am also taking a technical course at
                    SENAI to become a Full-Stack Developer, in addition to some extra courses on web development through
                    Udemy. Currently, I'm also enrolled in the BitEduca Full-Stack course. I have several projects on my
                    GitHub. My goal is to become an international reference in system
                    development and problem-solving. I am fluent in English. I am actively seeking an opportunity to
                    demonstrate my hard work and dedication.</p>
